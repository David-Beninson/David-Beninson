<h3>About</h3>
<hr/>
I am a highly motivated junior full-stack developer with experience in JavaScript, specifically using NextJS and ReactJS for the front-end and Node.js with MongoDB and Express for the back-end. My passion for creating efficient and user-friendly web applications, combined with my strong problem-solving skills and ability to adapt to new technologies, make me an ideal candidate for any full-stack development role. I graduated from SV college and currently pursuing my CS50X course, which is providing me with a strong foundation in computer science and software development.
